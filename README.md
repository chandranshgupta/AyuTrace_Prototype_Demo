An innovative traceability system designed for the **Smart India Hackathon 2025**. AyuTrace creates a tamper-proof digital record of an Ayurvedic herb's entire journey, from its precise geo-tagged collection point to the final QR code on a consumer's product.

## üöÄ **Live Demo**

Check out the live interactive prototype hosted on Vercel:
